# UFOs

## Overview
##### This project seeks to organise UFOs sighting data in an easy-to-access format on out webpage by creating 
##### filters that allow users to input search criteria.

## Results
##### The website data can now be filtered based on 5 criteria of date, city, state, country, and shape of the object. This way, a user can narrow down their search. A user may chose to apply 1 or more criteria to their search.

## Summary
##### Though the new design has improved the funtionality and efficiency of the website, there could still be some improvements. For example, 
* we could convert state, country, and shape to pick-list values to minimize chances of invalid inputs into the fields by the user. 
* We could break the unfiltered table into a number of pages to allow for a more readable amount of data on each page.
